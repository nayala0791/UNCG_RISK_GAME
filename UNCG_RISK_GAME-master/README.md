# UNCG_RISK_GAME
This is an application for Android devices that allows you to create a username and connect with another device and play a simple risk game with 8 different territories. Just as in the board game risk, this game uses an attacker 3 dice vs defender 2 dice algorithm to determine the winner or loser of an attack. 
It is also possible to play a local game (on one phone with a friend) with this App.
